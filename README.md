# Ubuntu Setup

This is an Ubuntu environment setup for my own Ubuntu computer.
If anyone wants to use it, remember to change the git configuration in `setup.sh` before running `setup.sh`, otherwise your code contributions will become mine.

## Usage
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/zxkyjimmy/UbuntuSetup
cd UbuntuSetup
./setup.sh
```
